# Dissertation_Longitudinal_Analysis_Of_Farm_Animal_Development

Description:

Background
A local (Leeds) farm has been collecting data on new-born lambs over several
years. After each lamb is weaned there is a series of measurements which record
the weight, and the month of the recording. Each lamb will belong to a sin-
gle/twin/triplet, and its feeding may be assisted. Interest may lie in how the
growth curves
(a) differ according to the number in the litter
(b) are affected by the date of birth and/or sex
(c) change according to bottle-feeding, or fostering
(d) depend on the age of the ewe (female parent).
The lamb data exists in electronic data files for the seasons 2016–2022 (and – if
desired – may be keyed in for 2023). An initial part of the project is to carry out
an exploratory data analysis, with checking of unusual values. Analyzing growth
curves can take several forms. Starting points include longitudinal data analysis
and fitting of parametric models. When the data are dense, then functional data
analysis may also be appropriate.

Objectives - 
1. Howdogender, breed, and litter size affect the growth trajectories of lambs?
2. What are the effective statistical and machine learning models for predicting lamb weight at various
 stages of growth?
3. How can these models be used to improve farm management practices, particularly in terms of opti
mizing breeding strategies and maximizing meat production?
